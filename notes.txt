		manually - easy to forget
		npm install - may be have an issue later
		prod build - expensive to change
		pull request - expensive to change
		npm start - slows start slightly

		Concurrent Tasks - you can chain your npm scripts together using npm-run-all --parallel

			example:
				"scripts": {
					"prestart" : "node buildScripts/startMessage.js",
					"start" : "npm-run-all --parallel security-check open:src",
					"open:src" : "node buildScripts/srcServer.js",
					"security-check" : "nsp check",
					"localtunnel" : "lt --port 3000",
					"share" : "npm-run-all --parallel open:src localtunnel"
				}
